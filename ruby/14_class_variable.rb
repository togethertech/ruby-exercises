# You can copy & paste your code from the last exercise to get started here
# Create a class called Car with the following things in it
# A class variable called cars_count and assign 0 to it
# Every time a new car is created, add 1 to the cars_count
# Write a class method called count, it should print to the console
# Hello, I have made <cars_count> cars
# Write an instance method, called introduce, it should print to the console
# Hello, I am a car that was made in a factory
# After ending the class, call the count class variable
# It should say "I have made 0 cars"
# Create 4 cars, call the introduce method on one of them
# It should say "Hello, I am a car that was made in a factory"
# Call the count class variable again
# It should say "I have made 4 cars"
