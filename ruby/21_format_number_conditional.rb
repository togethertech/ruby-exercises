# Copy your code from your last exercise if you want
# write a method that takes a phone number formatted as a local number
# with a 0 in front like this 0791231234
# and then it returns it formatted as an international number like this
# +27791231234
# Now change the method to only change the number if it was entered as a local number
# If the method is passed 0791231234 it should return +27791231234
# If the method is passed +27791231234 it should return +27791231234
