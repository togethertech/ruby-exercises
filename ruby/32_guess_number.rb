# Write a program where the computer is thinking of a number 5
# and the user has to guess the number
# The computer needs to start by saying
# "I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10"
# If the user puts in a 5, the program tells them they are right and exits
# If the user puts in any other answer, tell them go guess again
