# Copy your code from your last program if you want
# You think of a number between 1 and 100
# You tell the computer if it is too high or too low
# When you tell the computer it guessed too high,
# It remembers that number and never guess higher than that number again
# When you tell the computer it guessed too low
# It remembers that number and never guess lower than that number again
# Every time the computer will guess the number that is in the middle
# of the possible numbers
