# Write a program that displays the numbers 1 to 10 in the terminal
# Each number should be shown on a differnet line like this
# 1
# 2
# 3
# etc. All the way to 10
# You may only use the puts method one time so you will need some kind of a loop
# There are many right ways to do this, and any of them would be a right anser
# But I will give you a hint for the easiest one I can think of
# Ruby has a short syntax for creating a Range object with all the numbers,
# from one number to another number in the range
# That Range object comes with an each method, which takes a block of code, as an argument
# and runs that block of code once for every number in the Range
